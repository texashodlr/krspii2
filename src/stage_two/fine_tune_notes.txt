# General notes from my own learnings on the fine tuning script.

Code is being written on a laptop with a GPU: 4070M (~8GB VRAM)
	Intended to run on a workstation with a 3070Ti (~8GB VRAM)
	Intended to run a workstation with two 1070s (~16/8GB VRAM)


Noticed that all of my jsonl files begin with:
	{"text":[tokenids....]} so wrote the text_to_tokenid.py script to replace with:
	{"token_id":[tokenids...]}
